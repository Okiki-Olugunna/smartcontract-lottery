1. Users can enter the lottery with ethereum (ETH), based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over 
    - could make this more decentralised by making a DAO become the admin 
    - or could make the lottery automatically open & close based on some time parameters 
3. The lottery will select a random winner 


Testing:
